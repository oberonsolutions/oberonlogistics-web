<h4>New to the Business?</h4>
<p class="lead">If you're a brand new carrier, who just received your MC Authority, or
  you're planning to get one soon, then you've got a lot on your plate right now! You're
  going to need a dispatch service that can keep you loaded and on the road, dealing with
  brokers and sending out invoices so you can focus on driving and compliance. Not every
  dispatch service will work with new carriers, since many brokers require six months to a year
  of operations before they'll work with you. But we believe everyone has to start somewhere.
  That's why we welcome new carriers as clients, and will work with brokers and with you to establish
  those critical initial relationships.
